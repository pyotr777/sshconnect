## SSHconnect v1.19
 
# Utility for remote command execution with automatic data transfer 
 
 
## Requirements
 
Requires processing program (compiler etc.) installed on a server.
SSH connection to the server, authentication by password or by key.
 
 
## Usage

``` 
java -jar SSHconnect.jar [options] 
```
   
### Options
 
 All options can be set in configuration file sshconnect_conf.txt or passed through command line options.
 Command line options have higher priority. 
 
 Command line options (and parameter names in configuration file):

```
-ap	Path added to PATH environment variable on the server. Use it 
    to add processing program to the server PATH environment variable. 
    (Configuration file parameter name is add_path).		
-h	Server host address (Configuration file parameter name is host)		
-p	Server port number for SSH connection (Configuration file parameter name is port)
-u	User name for SSH connection authentication (Configuration file parameter name is user)	
-pw	Password for SSH user (Configuration file parameter name is password)		
-k	Path to RSA key for authentication on the server (Configuration file parameter name 
	is key) 		
-ph	Passphrase for RSA key (Configuration file parameter name is passphrase)	
```

Password, key and passphrase are optional, but either password or key is necessary 
for authentication on the server.

``` 
-rp	Path on the server to be used for temporary files (Configuration file parameter 
    name is remote_path) 		
-m	Command to be executed on the server for processing code (Configuration file parameter 
    name is build_command)
```
	
_Important notes on setting build_command:_

1. If you set an executable file name, don't forget to add "./" before it if it's not 
    on the server PATH
2. If build_command path has spaces, put single quotes around the path like this: 
    './makeproject 1.sh'

``` 
-lp	Path to source files, also the place to download code processing results from the server 
    (Configuration file parameter name is local_path)	
-ff	Comma-separated list of common filename patters to exclude files from uploading to 
    the server (Configuration file parameter name is file_filter). 
    Default is ".*, *.tar, *.html, *.zip, *.jpg".
-pf	Files with placeholders that must be replaced with server-side absolute path before 
	the code is processed on the server (Configuration file parameter name is preprocess_files).
	Absolute path replacement placeholder: "#[remote_path]" (without quotes).
-dp	Comma-separated list of filename patterns to download product files after building 
	source code. 
	Example: "*.xml, *.h"
-cp	Command pattern. Default value is "echo '#' | $SHELL -l" (without double quotes). 
	Command pattern is used to run build commands on "K" front-end with the purpose 
	of initializing environment variables, and it also works with other servers. 
	"#" in command pattern is replaced with commands, and resulting command stored 
	in temporary shell script file, which is executed on the server before build command.
```    
   
## Algorithm
 
 Establish SSH connection to the server.
 Parse files with absolute path replacement placeholders and replace placeholders with server-side absolute path. 
 Upload source code to the server.
 Execute build command on the server.
 Download product files (XML) files.
