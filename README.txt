 SSHconnect v1.03
 
 Utility for remote intermediate-code building for Fortran programs. 
 Requires front-end program of the XcalableMP compiler installed on a server to make intermediate codes.
 Can be used with K-scope (http://www.aics.riken.jp/ungi/soft/kscope/) or stand-alone.
 
 
 Requirements
 
 XcalableMP complier front-end (F_Front) and atool driver program installed on a server.
 SSH connection to the server, authentication by password or by key.
 
 
 Usage
 
 java -jar SSHconnect.jar [options] 
  
   
 Parameters
 
 All parameters can be set in configuration file sshconnect_conf.txt or passed through command line options.
 Command line options have higher priority. 
 
 Command line options and parameter names in configuration file
 	-ap		add_path			Path added to PATH environment variable on the server. Use it to add atool path to server PATH environment variable.		
	-h		host				Server host address		
	-p		port				Server port number for SSH connection
	-u		user				User name for SSH connection authentication		
	-pw		password			Password for SSH user		
	-k		key					Path to RSA key for authentication on the server 		
	-ph		passphrase			Passphrase for RSA key		
 	Password, key and passphrase are optional, but either password or key is necessary for authentication on the server.
 
	-rp		remote_path			Path on the server to be used for temporary files 		
	-m		build_command		Command to be executed on the server for building the project
	Important notes on setting build_command:
		1. If you set an executable file name, don't forget to add "./" before it if it's not on the server PATH
		2. If build_command path has spaces, put single quotes around the path like this: './makeproject 1.sh'
 
	-lp		local_path			Path to source files, also the place to download intermediate code from the server after the project has been built	
	-ff		file_filter			Comma-separated list of common filename patters to exclude files from uploading to the server
 	Default is ".*, *.tar, *.html, *.zip, *.jpg".
 
	-pf		preprocess_files	Files with placeholders that must be replaced with server-side absolute path before the project is built on the server
  	Absolute path replacement placeholder: "#[remote_path]" (without quotes).
    
   
 Algorithm
 
 Establish SSH connection to the server.
 Parse files with absolute path replacement placeholders and replace placeholders with server-side absolute path. 
 Upload source code to the server.
 Execute build command on the server.
 Download product files (XML) files.
